I am Joel, a technology enthusiast and a life-long learner.

The project is aimed at building a replica of Google's homepage (https://www.google.com) to demonstrating the knowledge and skills acquired in taking the microverse course and the Odin project.
The knowledge and skills acquired so far:
- Introduction to HTML and CSS.
- How to use git from the command line and manipulate the GitHub website.
